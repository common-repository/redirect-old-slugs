Allows you to change your post slugs without breaking your permalinks.

== Description ==

Redirect Old Slugs allows you to change your post slugs without breaking your permalinks.  People requesting the old link will be redirected to the new link.  This all happens automatically.

Note that this functionality was brought into WordPress core for version 2.1, so this plugin is not needed.  When you upgrade to WordPress version 2.1 or higher, your old slugs will be kept and will keep on being redirected without the need for this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `redirect-old-slugs.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I change a post slug more than once? =

All old post slugs are retained, and all will redirect to the current URL.  You can change your slug as many times as you like with impunity.
